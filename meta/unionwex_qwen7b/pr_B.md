# Combined skill: pr-release-ready + pr-structured

Follow every rule below.

## Rules from `pr-release-ready`

- List labels on a line `Labels: ` followed by lowercase labels separated by a comma and a space.
- Put the ticket on a separate line in the form `Ticket: <ID>`.
- Name the reviewers on a line `Reviewers: @handle`.
- The first line must be plain text of the form `PR: <title>`. Do not use a Markdown heading for the title.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Rollback`.
- Include a `## Risks` section with at least two bullet points that start with `- `.

## Rules from `pr-structured`

- Under Testing, list at least two checklist items written as `- [ ]` or `- [x]`.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Testing`.
- Give the tracker ticket on its own line as `Ticket: <ID>`.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Summary`.
- The first line must be a level-1 Markdown heading with the title, starting with `# `.
- Keep the whole description to at most 120 words.

If two rules cannot both hold, the rule from `pr-release-ready` wins.

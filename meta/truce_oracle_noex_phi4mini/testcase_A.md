# Merged skill: testcase-compact + testcase-traceable

This skill replaces `testcase-compact` and `testcase-traceable`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `testcase-compact`

- The first line must be the test ID and the title as `<ID>: <title>`, for example `TC-0412: Lockout after five failed logins`.
- Describe the starting state on a line that begins with `Preconditions: `.
- Give the priority on a line `Priority: P1`, `Priority: P2` or `Priority: P3`.
- Tag the kind of test on a line `Type: functional`, `Type: regression`, `Type: smoke` or `Type: negative`.
- State the pass criterion on a line that starts with `Expected result: `.

## Rules kept unchanged from `testcase-traceable`

- Link the feature under test on a line `Covers: <feature>`.
- List the data the tester needs on a line that starts with `Test data: `.
- Say how to restore the system afterwards on a line that starts with `Cleanup: `.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- 1. Write steps as a numbered list with at most five steps. 2. Include at least three numbered steps that are explicit checks, each starting with the word `Verify`. 3. Arrange the output carefully to satisfy both rules simultaneously. Combined Rule: Write the steps as a numbered list with at most five steps, and include at least three numbered steps that are explicit checks, each starting with the word `Verify`, ensuring the output is arranged carefully to satisfy both rules.

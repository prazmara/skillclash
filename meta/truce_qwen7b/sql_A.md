# Merged skill: sql-house-style + sql-warehouse-conventions

This skill replaces `sql-house-style` and `sql-warehouse-conventions`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `sql-house-style`

- Always exclude soft-deleted rows with the filter `deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Write all SQL keywords in UPPERCASE (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`).
- Give every aggregate an alias that ends in `_cnt`, `_sum` or `_avg`.
- The first line must be a comment that states the purpose: `-- Purpose: <one sentence>`.
- Wrap every monetary or averaged aggregate in `ROUND(..., 2)`.
- Always end the query with a `LIMIT` clause.

## Rules kept unchanged from `sql-warehouse-conventions`

- Cap the result size: every query needs a `limit` clause.
- Stage the source rows in a CTE named `base` (`with base as (...)`) and select from it.
- Filter date ranges with the half-open pattern `>=` start and `<` end. Never use `between` or `<=` for dates.
- Qualify source tables with the `analytics.` schema.
- Put a header comment `-- Owner: <team>` at the top of the query.

## Example

Request: Write the SQL query: revenue per country for orders created in January 2026, top 20 countries. Table orders(id, country, amount, created_at, deleted_at). Owning team: growth-analytics.

Output:

```
-- Owner: growth-analytics
-- Purpose: Calculate revenue per country for orders created in January 2026, top 20 countries

with base as (
    select country, sum(amount) as total_revenue
    from analytics.orders
    where created_at >= '2026-01-01' and created_at < '2026-02-01' and deleted_at is null
    group by country
)
select country, round(total_revenue, 2) as rounded_total_revenue
from base
order by rounded_total_revenue desc
limit 20;
```

# Merged skill: ticket-first-commits + conventional-commits

This skill replaces `ticket-first-commits` and `conventional-commits`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `ticket-first-commits`

- Start the subject line with the ticket ID in square brackets, for example `[PAY-311] `. Nothing may come before the bracket.
- Record test status as `Tested: yes` or `Tested: no` on its own line.
- Describe the change in the body as a bulleted list with at least two bullets that start with `- `.
- Say how to revert in a line that starts with `Rollback: `.
- Finish the message with a trailer block that contains the line `Refs: <TICKET-ID>`.
- Name the affected component in a line `Component: <name>`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `conventional-commits`

- Add a line that starts with `BREAKING CHANGE: ` and says `none` when nothing breaks.
- Add a body line `Risk: low`, `Risk: medium` or `Risk: high`.
- State whether the change was tested with a line `Tested: yes` or `Tested: no`.
- The very last line of the message must be the sign-off `Signed-off-by: <author name>`.
- Explain the motivation in a body line that starts with `Why: `.

## Example

Request: Write the commit message: add retry with backoff to the payment webhook handler. Ticket PAY-311. Author: Lena Ortiz. Component: webhooks.

Output:

```
[PAY-311] add retry with backoff to the payment webhook handler

- Improved error handling for payment webhook responses.
- Enhanced reliability by implementing exponential backoff strategy.

Risk: low
Tested: yes
Why: To improve the reliability of our payment processing system by adding retry logic with backoff.

Rollback: Revert the changes in the payment webhook handler to use the original error handling mechanism.

BREAKING CHANGE: none

Refs: PAY-311
Component: webhooks
Signed-off-by: Lena Ortiz
```

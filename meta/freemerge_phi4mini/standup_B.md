# standup-manager-digest

Managers read a digest of all updates and act on requests for help, so each update carries counts, tickets, a date and an explicit ask.

## Rules

- The first line must be `Daily update from <full name>`, for example `Daily update from Nora Lindqvist`.
- Summarize the workload on a line `Items: <n> done, <n> planned`.
- Give the expected finish date of the current task on a line `ETA: <YYYY-MM-DD>`.
- Put blockers on their own line beginning with `Blocked: `. If there are none, the line is `Blocked: none`.
- Collect all ticket IDs on one line `Tickets: <ID>, <ID>`, separated by a comma and a space.
- Finish the update with a line `Need help from: <person or team>`, or `Need help from: nobody`.

## Example

Request: Write the standup update for Nora Lindqvist, 2026-03-10, team Payments. Yesterday: finished the refund API pagination (PAY-518). Today: start the ledger export job (PAY-530), expected done 2026-03-12. Blocker: waiting for staging database credentials from the platform team.

Output:

```

Items: 1 done, 1 planned
Tickets: PAY-518, PAY-530
ETA: 2026-03-12

# Merged skill: support-formal + support-friendly

This skill replaces `support-formal` and `support-friendly`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `support-formal`

- Open with `Dear <full name>,` on the first line.
- Cite the case as `Ticket #<number>`.
- Do not use contractions such as `don't`, `we'll` or `you're`.
- Give the next steps as a numbered list with at least two steps (`1.`, `2.`).
- Sign with the agent's name followed by a line that ends with `Support Team`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `support-friendly`

- Lead the main message with a sentence that starts with `Good news:` or `Quick update:`.
- Invite a response with the exact phrase `reply to this email`.
- Set expectations with a time frame written as `within <n> hours` or `within <n> business days`.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Point the customer to the relevant help-center article by including its `https://help.example.com/...` URL. Links may appear only on a final line that starts with `Links:`.

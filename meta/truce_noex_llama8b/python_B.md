# Merged skill: python-numpy-style + python-google-style

This skill replaces `python-numpy-style` and `python-google-style`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `python-numpy-style`

- Start the module with `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Show a doctest-style example that uses `>>>`.
- State the time complexity as `Complexity: O(...)`.
- Export the function by defining `__all__`.
- Mark each non-obvious step with a comment that starts with `# NOTE:`.
- Write the docstring in NumPy style, with a `Parameters` header underlined by dashes. Never use `Args:`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `python-google-style`

- Name the function with a verb prefix: `get_`, `compute_`, `build_`, `parse_`, `validate_`, `find_`, `count_`, `format_` or `to_`.
- Write the docstring in Google style with `Args:` and `Returns:` sections. Never use underlined section headers.
- Annotate every parameter and the return value with type hints.
- Reject invalid input by raising `ValueError`.
- Include at least one usage example with a `>>>` prompt in the docstring.
- Reply with one Python code block and nothing outside it.

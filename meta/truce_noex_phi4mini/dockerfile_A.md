# Merged skill: dockerfile-hardened + dockerfile-catalog

This skill replaces `dockerfile-hardened` and `dockerfile-catalog`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `dockerfile-hardened`

- syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
- STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM
- HEALTHCHECK
- USER 10001
- ARG APP_VERSION=dev
- WORKDIR /opt/service

## Rules kept unchanged from `dockerfile-catalog`

- Make the container stop cleanly by adding the instruction `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`
- Use `WORKDIR /srv/app` as the working directory. The file must not set any other working directory.
- Explain each `RUN` instruction with a comment line directly above it that starts with `# step: `.
- Describe the image with a `LABEL` instruction that sets `org.opencontainers.image.description`.
- Put a header comment `# Owner: <team>` at the top of the file.
- Fix the container time zone with `ENV TZ=UTC`

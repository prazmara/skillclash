# Merged skill: story-sprint-ready + story-portfolio

This skill replaces `story-sprint-ready` and `story-portfolio`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `story-sprint-ready`

- Name who the story is for on a line `Persona: <persona>`.
- Say how success will be measured on a line that starts with `Metric: `.
- Add one test scenario as three lines that start with `Given `, `When ` and `Then `.
- List at least two acceptance criteria as open checkboxes, one per line, written `- [ ] ...`.
- The first line must be a level-1 Markdown heading that holds only the title, for example `# Save cart for later`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `story-portfolio`

- Say what the story does not cover on a line that starts with `Out of scope: `.
- Rate the business value on a line `Value: high`, `Value: medium` or `Value: low`.
- List blocking tickets on a line that starts with `Depends on: `, and write `Depends on: none` when there are none.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- The line directly below the title must be `Epic: <epic name>`, and the next line must be `Story points: <n>`.

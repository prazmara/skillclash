# Merged skill: bug-triage-form + bug-dev-handoff

This skill replaces `bug-triage-form` and `bug-dev-handoff`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `bug-triage-form`

- Keep the description free of code formatting. Backticks may appear only on a final line that starts with `Error text:`.
- The first line must be plain text of the form `Title: <one-line summary>`.
- Contrast the outcome in two lines that start with `Expected: ` and `Actual: `.
- Give the app version and the platform on one line that starts with `Environment: `.
- Rate the severity on a line `Severity: S1`, `Severity: S2`, `Severity: S3` or `Severity: S4`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `bug-dev-handoff`

- Name the person who found the bug on a line `Reported by: <full name>`.
- Offer a way around the bug on a line that starts with `Workaround: `, and write `Workaround: none` if there is none.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Reproducibility: always, Regression: yes or Reproducibility: sometimes, Regression: no or Reproducibility: once, Regression: unknown.

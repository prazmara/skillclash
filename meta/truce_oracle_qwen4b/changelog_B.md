# Merged skill: release-announcement + keep-a-changelog

This skill replaces `release-announcement` and `keep-a-changelog`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `release-announcement`

- The first line must be the title `# Release <version> (<Month D, YYYY>)`, for example `# Release 2.3.0 (March 2, 2026)`.
- Open with a one-sentence summary on a line that starts with `Highlights: `.
- Tell users what to do on a line that starts with `Upgrade: `.
- Put the name of each new feature in bold with `**`.
- Mark incompatible changes with `BREAKING:` exactly.

## Rules kept unchanged from `keep-a-changelog`

- Group changes under at least two of the headings `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`.
- Reference issues in parentheses as `(#<number>)`.
- Bullets are fragments: no bullet may end with a period.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Credit every contributor by @handle. Bullets describe the change only. No bullet may contain an @handle.

## Example

Request: Write the changelog entry for version 2.3.0, released on 2026-03-02. Added CSV export for reports (issue #412, by @dana). Fixed a timezone bug in scheduled reports (issue #398, by @lee). Breaking: the /v1/export endpoint was removed.

Output:

```
# Release 2.3.0 (March 2, 2026)

Highlights: Added CSV export for reports and fixed a timezone bug in scheduled reports. Users should update their scripts to use the new /v2/export endpoint instead of /v1/export.

Upgrade: Replace all calls to the /v1/export endpoint with /v2/export.

### Added
- **CSV export for reports** (#412, by @dana)

### Fixed
- A timezone bug in scheduled reports (#398, by @lee)

BREAKING: The /v1/export endpoint was removed.
```

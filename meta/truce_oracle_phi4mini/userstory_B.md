# Merged skill: story-sprint-ready + story-portfolio

This skill replaces `story-sprint-ready` and `story-portfolio`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `story-sprint-ready`

- The first line must be a level-1 Markdown heading that holds only the title, for example `# Save cart for later`.
- Name who the story is for on a line `Persona: <persona>`.
- Add one test scenario as three lines that start with `Given `, `When ` and `Then `.
- Say how success will be measured on a line that starts with `Metric: `.
- List at least two acceptance criteria as open checkboxes, one per line, written `- [ ] ...`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `story-portfolio`

- Rate the business value on a line `Value: high`, `Value: medium` or `Value: low`.
- Say what the story does not cover on a line that starts with `Out of scope: `.
- List blocking tickets on a line that starts with `Depends on: `, and write `Depends on: none` when there are none.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Place the estimate as `Story points: <n>` directly under the title, followed by the epic name as `Epic: <epic name>` on the line directly below the title.

## Example

Request: Write the user story: shoppers want to save their cart and come back to it later on another device. Ticket SHOP-88. Epic: Checkout. Persona: returning shopper. Estimate: 5 points.

Output:

```
# Save cart for later
Persona: returning shopper
Given a shopper has items in their cart
When they choose to save their cart for later
Then they should be able to return to their saved cart on another device
Metric: User satisfaction with the saved cart feature
- [ ] User can save their cart successfully
- [ ] User can return to their saved cart on another device
Value: high
Out of scope: does not include saving payment information
Depends on: none
Story points: 5
Epic: Checkout
```

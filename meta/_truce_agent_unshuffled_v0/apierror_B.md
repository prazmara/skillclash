# Merged skill: api-errors-public + api-errors-internal

This skill replaces `api-errors-public` and `api-errors-internal`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `api-errors-public`

- Name the machine-readable code field `errorCode` (camelCase). Never use snake_case keys.
- Include a field `details` that holds a non-empty list of specifics.
- Include a field `timestamp` with a UTC time in the form `2026-03-02T10:15:00Z`.
- Include a field `severity` with the value `low`, `medium` or `high`.
- Explain the error for humans in the `message` field.

## Rules kept unchanged from `api-errors-internal`

- Include the HTTP status as an integer in the field `status`.
- Include a boolean field `retryable`.
- Include a field `docs` with an `https://` link to the error documentation.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Add a developer hint that starts with `Hint:` and says how to fix the request, and put it inside the JSON object as the string value of a field `hint`, for example `"hint": "Hint: wait 60 seconds before retrying"`. The reply must be exactly one JSON object and nothing else, so that it parses as JSON, so never write the hint or any other text before or after the object.

## Example

Request: Write the JSON error response body for a request that exceeded the rate limit of 100 requests per minute on POST /v1/payments.

Output:

```
{
  "errorCode": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Rate limit of 100 requests per minute exceeded on POST /v1/payments.",
  "details": ["limit=100/min", "endpoint=POST /v1/payments"],
  "timestamp": "2026-03-02T10:15:00Z",
  "severity": "medium",
  "status": 429,
  "retryable": true,
  "docs": "https://docs.example.com/errors/rate-limit-exceeded",
  "hint": "Hint: wait 60 seconds before retrying, or request a higher limit."
}
```

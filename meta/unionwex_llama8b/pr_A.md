# Combined skill: pr-structured + pr-release-ready

Follow every rule below.

## Rules from `pr-structured`

- Under Testing, list at least two checklist items written as `- [ ]` or `- [x]`.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Testing`.
- Give the tracker ticket on its own line as `Ticket: <ID>`.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Summary`.
- The first line must be a level-1 Markdown heading with the title, starting with `# `.
- Keep the whole description to at most 120 words.

## Rules from `pr-release-ready`

- List labels on a line `Labels: ` followed by lowercase labels separated by a comma and a space.
- Put the ticket on a separate line in the form `Ticket: <ID>`.
- Name the reviewers on a line `Reviewers: @handle`.
- The first line must be plain text of the form `PR: <title>`. Do not use a Markdown heading for the title.
- Include a section with the exact heading `## Rollback`.
- Include a `## Risks` section with at least two bullet points that start with `- `.

If two rules cannot both hold, the rule from `pr-structured` wins.

## Example

Request: Write the pull request description: add rate limiting to the login endpoint. Ticket AUTH-207. Reviewer: @sam. Labels: security, backend.

Output:

```
PR: Add rate limiting to the login endpoint

## Summary
This PR adds rate limiting to the login endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Testing
- [ ] Test the login endpoint with a high number of requests to verify rate limiting is applied
- [x] Test the login endpoint with a normal number of requests to verify it functions as expected

## Risks
- The rate limiting may cause issues for users with slow internet connections
- The rate limiting may not be effective against sophisticated brute-force attacks

## Rollback
If the rate limiting causes issues, we can remove it and implement a different security measure.

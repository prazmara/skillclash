# Merged skill: alert-chatops + alert-pager

This skill replaces `alert-chatops` and `alert-pager`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `alert-chatops`

- The first line must be `Alert <ID> firing on <service>`, for example `Alert ALR-7731 firing on checkout-api`.
- Describe what customers notice on a line that begins with `User impact: `.
- Give the runbook address on its own line in the form `Runbook: <url>`.
- Explain how to acknowledge with the line `Ack: reply ack <alert ID>`, for example `Ack: reply ack ALR-7731`.
- List at least three likely causes as bullets that start with `- ` under a line that reads exactly `Likely causes:`.
- Tell the responder where to start on a line that begins with `First action: `.

## Rules kept unchanged from `alert-pager`

- Link the runbook on a line `Runbook: <url>`.
- The whole message must fit on a pager screen: at most 400 characters, counting spaces and line breaks.
- The first line must be `[<SEVERITY>] <service>: <summary>` with the severity in capitals, one of `[CRITICAL]`, `[WARNING]`, `[INFO]`.
- Say how long the condition has held on a line `For: <n>m`, in whole minutes.
- Name the environment on a line `Env: <name>`.
- Give the measurement on a line `Value: <current> (threshold <limit>)`.

## Example

Request: Write the alert notification: p99 latency of the checkout-api service in prod-eu is 2.4 s, above the 1.5 s threshold, for 10 minutes. Severity: critical. Alert ID ALR-7731. Runbook: https://runbooks.example.com/checkout-latency.

Output:

```
[CRITICAL] checkout-api: p99 latency above threshold  
For: 10m  
Env: prod-eu  
Value: 2.4s (threshold 1.5s)  
User impact: Users experience slow checkout process  
Runbook: https://runbooks.example.com/checkout-latency  
Ack: reply ack ALR-7731  
Likely causes:  
- Database query slowdown  
- External payment service latency  
- Increased load from traffic spike  
First action: Check recent deploys and metrics in monitoring dashboard
```

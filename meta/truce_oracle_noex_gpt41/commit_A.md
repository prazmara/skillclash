# Merged skill: conventional-commits + ticket-first-commits

This skill replaces `conventional-commits` and `ticket-first-commits`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `conventional-commits`

- Start the subject line with a lowercase type prefix and a colon, one of `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Nothing may come before the type.
- Explain the motivation in a body line that starts with `Why: `.
- Add a body line `Risk: low`, `Risk: medium` or `Risk: high`.
- Add a line that starts with `BREAKING CHANGE: ` and says `none` when nothing breaks.
- State whether the change was tested with a line `Tested: yes` or `Tested: no`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `ticket-first-commits`

- Describe the change in the body as a bulleted list with at least two bullets that start with `- `.
- Name the affected component in a line `Component: <name>`.
- Say how to revert in a line that starts with `Rollback: `.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Finish the message with a trailer block that contains the line `Refs: <TICKET-ID>`, and ensure the very last line of the message is the sign-off `Signed-off-by: <author name>`. The `Signed-off-by: <author name>` line must come after the `Refs: <TICKET-ID>` line within the trailer block.

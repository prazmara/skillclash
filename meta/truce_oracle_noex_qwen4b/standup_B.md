# Merged skill: standup-manager-digest + standup-async-thread

This skill replaces `standup-manager-digest` and `standup-async-thread`. It keeps every rule of both skills that can hold at the same time. Follow every rule below.

## Rules kept unchanged from `standup-manager-digest`

- The first line must be `Daily update from <full name>`, for example `Daily update from Nora Lindqvist`.
- Summarize the workload on a line `Items: <n> done, <n> planned`.
- Collect all ticket IDs on one line `Tickets: <ID>, <ID>`, separated by a comma and a space.
- Give the expected finish date of the current task on a line `ETA: <YYYY-MM-DD>`.
- Put blockers on their own line beginning with `Blocked: `. If there are none, the line is `Blocked: none`.

## Rules kept unchanged from `standup-async-thread`

- List finished work as bullets that start with `- ` under a line that reads exactly `Done:`.
- List planned work as bullets that start with `- ` under a line that reads exactly `Next:`.
- Say whether the sprint goal is safe on a line `On track: yes` or `On track: no`.

## Reconciled rules (each one satisfies a rule of both skills at once)

- Finish the update with a line `Need help from: <person or team>`, or `Need help from: nobody`, and end with the hashtag line `#standup #<team>` with the team name in lowercase.
